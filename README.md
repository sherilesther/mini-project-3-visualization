# Mini Project 3 – Data Visualization and Statistics

## Objective
The goal of this project is to visualize a processed dataset using Python and
compute descriptive statistics to better understand the data.

## Dataset Used
The dataset used in this project is a cleaned dataset obtained from Mini Project 2.

## Visualizations Created
The following visualizations were generated using Python:
- Histogram to understand data distribution
- Bar chart to compare categories
- Boxplot to identify outliers
- Scatter plot to observe relationships between variables

## Statistical Analysis
The following descriptive statistics were computed:
- Mean
- Median
- Standard Deviation
- Percentiles

## Tools Used
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib / Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Conclusion
The visualizations and statistics help identify patterns, distributions,
and potential outliers in the dataset, enabling better interpretation of the data.
